When I watched <i>The Beyond</i> on Shudder, I knew it was going to be a bit on the "hokey" side of things. After all, the movie was released in 1981. Special effects weren't as good back then, so I wasn't expecting to see gore on today's scale.

I was surprised to learn that censors in 1983 basically cut the film to almost nothing and that it took nearly 20 years and help from Quentin Tarantino to get the uncut version released in the US. Apparently today's standards of fright and gore would be far too much for 1983's sensibilities, as I'll be honest, the gore wasn't that bad at all and I didn't see too much in the way of "scary" things. Then again, I don't scare easily when it comes to movies and books.

T﻿he plot is interesting enough although I wouldn't say it is the most interesting movie I've ever watched. It kept me interested and entertained for the roughly hour-and-a-half that the movie ran for, which is all I asked for in the scheme of things. 

I﻿ gave the movie three stars, which means I'd watch it again, although it wouldn't be my first choice.
